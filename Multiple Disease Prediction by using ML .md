# Multiple Disease Prediction System

## Overview
The **Multiple Disease Prediction System** is a machine learning-based application that helps predict the likelihood of various diseases using user-provided data. The system leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to offer reliable predictions for multiple diseases.

## Features
- **Multi-Disease Prediction**: Supports predictions for several diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for entering data and receiving predictions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, scales data, and processes features for better prediction accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements various models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) to predict diseases.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.
  - Scikit-learn: For machine learning modeling and evaluation.
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
  - Flask or Streamlit: For building the web interface.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiple-disease-prediction.git
   cd multiple-disease-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   or, for Streamlit-based apps:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5000` (Flask) or the URL provided by Streamlit.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset can be sourced from publicly available health data repositories such as Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Structure**: The dataset includes columns such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, etc., along with labels indicating the presence or absence of specific diseases.

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values (imputation or removal).
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize or scale numerical features.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train multiple models for different diseases.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Use trained models to predict the likelihood of diseases based on user inputs.

4. **Output**:
   - Display disease prediction results with confidence scores.

## Example Use Cases
- **Healthcare Professionals**: Aid in preliminary diagnosis based on patient data.
- **Patients**: Provide early warnings or insights about potential health risks.
- **Medical Researchers**: Analyze patterns in health data.
